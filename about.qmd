It was a fun and enlightening time in IS415 G1.

# Load the necessary library
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

# Define the team members and their respective picture paths
prof <- "**Prof Kam Tin Seong**"
prof_picture_paths <- c("PersonalPics/Prof.jpg")

# Create a data frame with team members and picture paths
prof_df <- data.frame(Prof = prof, Picture = prof_picture_paths)

# Add HTML image tags to display pictures in the table
