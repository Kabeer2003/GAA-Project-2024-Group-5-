### Our Objective:

Culinary Crossroads aims to utilize spatial point patterns to enhance exploration of hawker centres in Singapore. Objectives include creating comprehensive maps of hawker centre locations, identifying regions with higher concentrations, and providing individual maps for detailed analysis. Integration of a user-friendly Shiny app allows users to indicate preferred regions for exploration. Additionally, the project categorizes hawker centre food by cuisine types and dietary preferences, enabling personalized food recommendations aligned with user tastes and dietary restrictions. Overall, the objectives seek to provide a tailored and user-friendly platform for discovering culinary delights in Singapore's vibrant hawker culture.

### Steps in this Project :
-   Data Collection and Wrangling:

    -   Gather geospatial data on hawker centre locations, cuisine types, dietary types in Singapore.

-   Building the functions

    -   Function 1: Spatial Point Patterns for Hawker Centres in SG:
        -   Map Creation: Develop a map displaying all hawker centres in Singapore.
        -   Regional Analysis: Highlight regions with a higher concentration of hawker centres.
        -   Regional Maps: Provide individual maps for each region to further analyze hawker centre distribution.
        -   Shiny App Integration: Integrate a Shiny app allowing users to indicate (input) their preferred region for hawker centre exploration.
    -   Function 2: Spatial Point Patterns for Hawker Centre Food Based on Type of Food:
        -   Food Type Map: Create a map illustrating the types of food available at hawker centres, categorising them based on cuisine types.
        -   User Input: Develop a Shiny app interface for users to input their preferred food types, allowing for personalised food recommendations.
    -   Function 3: Spatial Point Patterns for Hawker Centre Food Based on Dietary Preferences:
        -   Dietary Options Map: Develop a map indicating hawker centres with specific dietary options such as halal, vegan, etc.
        -   User Preferences: Enable users to input their dietary preferences through a Shiny app, ensuring personalized recommendations aligned with their dietary restrictions.

### Benefits:

-   The project offers numerous benefits, including facilitating exploration of Singapore's diverse hawker culture through user-friendly maps and personalized recommendations. By highlighting regions with higher concentrations of hawker centres and categorizing food options based on cuisine types and dietary preferences, users can easily discover culinary delights tailored to their tastes. The integration of a Shiny app enhances user engagement and interaction, allowing for seamless navigation and exploration of hawker centres. Ultimately, the project promotes cultural exploration, enhances user experience, and fosters a vibrant community of food enthusiasts in Singapore.

### Data Sources
